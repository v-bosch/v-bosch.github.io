This website is under construction! 
I am a PhD student supervised by Prof. Dr. Tim C Kietzmann in the Machine Learning group at the Institute for Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück. I work in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, i.e., [neuroconnectionism](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00705-w). My work focuses on neural decoding and the development of new neural network architectures that model vision. I am generally interested in (neuro)philosophy, machine learning and all other techniques we can use to understand the human condition. 

  I completed my Master's degree in Cognitive Computing (Artificial Intelligence) at Radboud University (Donders Institute, Nijmegen). Feel free to contact me!
